Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 2.1 by Gian Marco Del Freo

2
00:00:10 -> 00:00:13
The criterion that I will explain will be the success criterion 2.4.2

3
00:00:14 -> 00:00:19
I decided to split this presentation into four stages

4
00:00:15 -> 00:00:21
The first which is the fundamental phase, is the intent of the criterion

5
00:00:22 -> 00:00:25
The second phase deals with the description of the criterion

6
00:00:23 -> 00:00:35
In the third phase I will explain what benefits users can derive from this criterion

7
00:00:24 -> 00:00:39
While the fourth section will argue the argument of the criterion on the practical side

8
00:00:41 -> 00:00:52
Intent of the criterion: The purpose of this success criterion is to help users find content and find their way around it by ensuring that each web page has a descriptive title.

9
00:00:53 -> 00:01:00
Titles identify your current location without requiring users to read or interpret the content of the page.

10
00:01:01 -> 00:01:11
When titles appear on site maps or search results lists, users can identify the content they need more quickly.

11
00:01:12 -> 00:01:19
User programs make the page title easily available to the user for identifying the page.

12
00:01:20 -> 00:01:38
Policy description: All HTML and XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) documents, including those in individual frames in a frame set, have a title element in the head section that defines the purpose of the document in a simple sentence.

13
00:01:38 -> 00:01:48
This allows users to quickly find their way around the site without having to search for orientation information in the body of the page.

14
00:01:39 -> 00:02:01
Note that the title element (mandatory), which appears only once in a document, is different from the title attribute, which can be applied to almost all HTML and XHTML elements.

15
00:02:03 -> 00:02:07
Advantages and benefits of the criterion, this section is one of the most important

16
00:02:07 -> 00:02:16
The first benefit: This criterion is beneficial for all users in allowing users to identify quickly and easily

17
00:02:17 -> 00:02:22
if the information on the web page is relevant to their needs.

18
00:02:23 -> 00:02:32
People with visual impairments will benefit from the ability to differentiate content when multiple web pages are open.

19
00:02:33 -> 00:02:44
People with cognitive disabilities, limited short-term memory, and reading difficulties also benefit from the ability to identify content by title.

20
00:02:45 -> 00:02:56
This criterion is also advantageous for people with severe motor disabilities whose operating mode is based on audio while browsing the Web pages.

21
00:02:58 -> 00:03:11
Understanding the success criterion 2.4.2, introductory page: The goal of this technique is to give each web page a descriptive title

22
00:03:12 -> 00:03:18
The titles in fact help users find content and therefore orient themselves within them

23
00:03:19 -> 00:03:26
Now let's see the requirements that are needed precisely for a web page to comply with this criterion, that is, the titration criterion

24
00:03:27 -> 00:03:41
The first criterion of course is to verify that the web page has a title defined within the "<head>" tag through the "<title>" tag.

25
00:03:42 -> 00:03:52
The title obviously must briefly represent what the content of the page is, so we are talking about the second requirement

26
00:03:43 -> 00:04:00
Then, check that the title is relevant to the content of the web page

27
00:04:01 -> 00:04:17
Here, I "created" a blog, which deals with some articles about the web, so to represent the title of the page I wrote "Blog, various and any from the world of the web"

28
00:04:18 -> 00:04:38
The last requirement is to verify that the web page can be identified by the title, this refers above all to the "title =" "" attribute that we now see

29
00:04:39 -> 00:04:40
It is found in this case in the navigation menu, in fact this particular attribute specifies information about the element

30
00:00:41 -> 00:04:52
The information is often displayed as the text of a tooltip, when the mouse is moved over the element, this is therefore used by the software (screen reader etc.)

31
00:04:53 -> 00:05:00
To find information more quickly within the addresses of the page or within additional elements.
